# workday-scheduler

## Description
This application allows the user to save events for each hour of the workday. It shows the current date at the top of the screen and the hours below. It may help employees with busy schedules to manage time effectively. 

As the day progresses, the hours will change color to indicate whether they are happening presently, are in the past, or are in the future.
